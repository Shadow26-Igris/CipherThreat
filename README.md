**CipherThreat** is a beginner-friendly full-stack web project focused on **cyber security awareness and cybercrime assistance**. This project was created as my **first independent project** while learning full-stack development, with the goal of applying frontend and backend concepts to a real-world problem.

The application serves as an informational and assistance platform that educates users about cybercrimes, how they occur, how to stay protected, and how to report incidents through a centralized interface.

##  Motivation

Cybercrime awareness in India is still limited, and official resources such as cybercrime portals, I4C, and other government services are spread across multiple websites. This fragmentation can be confusing for users, especially during stressful situations involving cyber fraud or online abuse.

CipherThreat was designed to **unify cyber security information and reporting features into a single, easy-to-use web platform**, so users do not have to struggle to find the right resources.

## Project Overview

CipherThreat provides:
- Educational content about different types of cybercrimes
- Information on how cybercrimes occur
- Preventive measures and best practices
- Latest cyber security news using third-party APIs
- A complaint registration and tracking system
- Backend data storage for complaints and user inputs

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with **frontend design, backend development, APIs, and database integration**.
