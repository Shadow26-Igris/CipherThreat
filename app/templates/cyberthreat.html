            <h1>Computer Viruses</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to attach itself to legitimate files or
            programs and replicate when those files are executed. Unlike worms, which spread independently, viruses
            require user actions like opening an infected file to activate. Once active, they can corrupt data, delete
            files, or disrupt system operations.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Computer viruses are characterized by their ability to infect a wide range of file types, including
            executables, documents, and scripts. They often use stealth techniques to avoid detection, such as
            encrypting their code or modifying themselves. Many viruses lie dormant until a specific trigger activates
            them, such as a certain date or user action.

            <h3>Common Types</h3>
            Different types of computer viruses exist, each with unique behaviors. File infector viruses attach to
            executable files and spread when they are run. Macro viruses target software like Microsoft Word, embedding
            malicious code into documents. Boot sector viruses affect the boot sector of storage devices, making them
            active during system startup.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Infected systems often display telltale signs like slow performance, frequent crashes, and unexpected
            pop-ups. Files may become corrupted or disappear entirely. In extreme cases, users might lose access to
            their operating systems if critical system files are damaged or deleted.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Some infamous computer viruses include the Melissa virus, which spread through email attachments in 1999,
            and the CIH (Chernobyl) virus, which caused extensive data loss and even hardware damage by overwriting
            system BIOS</p>

            <h1>Worms</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Worms are a type of self-replicating malware that can spread across networks without requiring user actions
            or attaching themselves to a host program. They exploit vulnerabilities in systems or networks to propagate,
            often causing significant damage by consuming resources or distributing additional malware.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Unlike viruses, worms operate independently and do not need a host file or user interaction to spread. They
            are highly effective in exploiting network security flaws and can propagate rapidly, often infecting
            thousands of systems in minutes. Worms primarily aim to disrupt network traffic or install backdoors for
            attackers.

            <h3>Mechanisms of Spread</h3>
            Worms utilize various methods to spread, such as email attachments containing malicious code,
            vulnerabilities in network services, or shared file systems. Some worms also leverage weak passwords or
            outdated software, exploiting them to gain access to new hosts and replicate themselves.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            A system or network infected by worms may experience significant slowdowns due to excessive traffic. Users
            might notice unusual activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or unexpected files appearing on their
            systems. Additionally, network administrators often detect a sharp increase in data transmission.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            The Morris Worm, the first widely recognized internet worm, caused significant disruption in 1988. Another
            example is the SQL Slammer worm, which exploited a Microsoft SQL vulnerability in 2003, spreading globally
            in less than 10 minutes and causing widespread outages.</p>

            <h1>Trojans</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Named after the legendary Trojan Horse, Trojans are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software.
            They deceive users into installing them, granting attackers unauthorized access to systems. Unlike viruses
            and worms, Trojans do not replicate but often serve as gateways for other malware.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Trojans rely on deception to gain entry into a system, often masquerading as useful tools, games, or
            updates. Once installed, they may grant attackers control over the infected device, monitor user activity,
            or steal sensitive data. Many Trojans are tailored to target specific vulnerabilities or systems.

            <h3>Types of Trojans</h3>
            Several types of Trojans exist, each with specific purposes. Banking Trojans aim to steal financial data,
            while Remote Access Trojans (RATs) provide full control of the infected device. Dropper Trojans are used to
            install other malware, and destructive Trojans can delete files or crash systems.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Trojans often operate silently, but their effects may become evident over time. Users might notice unusual
            system behavior, unauthorized account access, or missing data. In some cases, security software may detect
            and alert users to the presence of malicious files.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Prominent examples include the Zeus Trojan, which targeted banking credentials, and the Emotet Trojan, known
            for its adaptability and use as a malware delivery platform.</p>

            <h1>Ransomware</h1>

            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a victim’s files or locks their systems, demanding payment
            (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access. It is one of the most financially devastating cyber threats,
            targeting individuals, businesses, and critical infrastructure alike.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Ransomware typically uses strong encryption algorithms to lock files, rendering them inaccessible without a
            decryption key. It spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or compromised software. Many
            ransomware strains include countdown timers to pressure victims into paying quickly.

            <h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
            The attack process involves infiltrating a system, encrypting files, and displaying a ransom note. Some
            ransomware also exfiltrates sensitive data, threatening to release it unless the ransom is paid. Even after
            payment, victims may not always recover their files.

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            Victims of ransomware attacks often suffer significant financial losses due to ransom payments, downtime,
            and data recovery efforts. Businesses may face reputational damage, while critical infrastructure attacks
            can disrupt essential services like healthcare or energy.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            WannaCry was a global ransomware outbreak in 2017 that exploited a Windows vulnerability, affecting over
            200,000 systems. Ryuk, another notorious strain, has targeted large organizations, demanding ransoms
            exceeding millions of dollars.</p>

            <h1>Spyware</h1>

            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Spyware is malicious software designed to secretly monitor user activities and collect sensitive
            information, such as login credentials or financial data. It often operates without the victim's knowledge,
            making it a significant threat to privacy.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Spyware works stealthily in the background, collecting data and transmitting it to attackers. It is often
            bundled with legitimate software or downloaded unintentionally from malicious websites. Some spyware
            specifically targets mobile devices to access SMS messages, GPS locations, or app data.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            Spyware can take various forms, including keyloggers that record keystrokes, ad tracking cookies that
            monitor browsing habits, and system monitors that log all user activities. Advanced spyware may even access
            webcams or microphones.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Infected systems may experience slower performance, unexpected pop-ups, or unauthorized changes to settings.
            Users might notice unusual data usage or battery drain, especially on mobile devices. Security software
            alerts may indicate the presence of spyware.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Pegasus spyware, developed by the NSO Group, has been used in targeted surveillance campaigns. Another
            example, CoolWebSearch, redirected users to malicious websites and stole browser data.</p>

            <h1>Adware</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Adware is a type of software that automatically delivers unwanted advertisements to users. While some adware
            is relatively harmless and simply designed to generate revenue through ads, others are malicious and can
            compromise user privacy or lead to further malware infections.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Adware often comes bundled with free software downloads, tricking users into installation. Once active, it
            displays intrusive ads, redirects browsers to promotional pages, or alters browser settings. Some adware
            also tracks browsing habits, collecting data for targeted advertising or even selling it to third parties.

            <h3>Risks</h3>
            Adware can expose users to malicious websites and downloads, leading to more severe malware infections. It
            can also slow down system performance, consume bandwidth, and compromise user privacy. Over time, it may
            render a browser or device nearly unusable.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Affected users frequently encounter excessive pop-up ads, unexpected browser redirects, and changes to their
            homepage or default search engine. Browsing speed may significantly decrease, and additional unwanted
            software might be installed without consent.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Gator was a popular adware program that displayed pop-up ads and collected user data. Another notable
            example, Fireball, was a browser hijacker that altered search engine results and tracked browsing activity
            for financial gain.</p>

            <h1>Rootkits</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            A rootkit is a type of malware designed to provide unauthorized, high-privilege access to a computer system
            while hiding its presence. Attackers use rootkits to maintain control over infected devices, often evading
            detection for extended periods.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Rootkits can operate at various levels, from user-mode applications to kernel-level processes. They are
            typically installed by exploiting vulnerabilities or tricking users into running malicious software.
            Rootkits are challenging to detect, as they can conceal their files, processes, and network connections.

            <h3>Modes of Infection</h3>
            Rootkits are delivered through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or compromised software. Once
            installed, they grant attackers administrative access to the system, allowing them to manipulate data,
            disable security tools, and monitor user activities.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Rootkits are notoriously difficult to identify, but signs of infection may include disabled antivirus
            software, hidden files or processes, unusual network activity, or unexplained system crashes. Advanced
            rootkits may leave no visible traces.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            The Sony BMG rootkit, bundled with music CDs, sparked controversy for compromising user systems. Necurs is
            another well-known rootkit that spread ransomware and spam while avoiding detection.</p>

            <h1>Keyloggers</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Keyloggers are malicious programs or devices designed to record keystrokes on a keyboard. Their primary
            purpose is to capture sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages,
            often leading to identity theft or financial fraud.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Keyloggers can be software-based, running silently in the background, or hardware-based, physically attached
            to a device. They often form part of broader malware campaigns, delivered through phishing emails, infected
            websites, or malicious downloads.

            <h3>Delivery Methods</h3>
            Keyloggers are commonly spread through phishing scams, malicious attachments, or compromised websites.
            Hardware keyloggers, meanwhile, require physical access to the target device, often hidden within keyboard
            connectors or cables.

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            Keyloggers rarely display overt signs of infection, but users might notice increased system lag,
            unauthorized account activities, or unexplained spikes in outgoing data traffic. Security software may
            occasionally detect their presence.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Ardamax and Revealer Keylogger are widely recognized software keyloggers used for both legitimate monitoring
            and malicious purposes. Advanced versions can also capture screenshots or record system activities in
            addition to keystrokes.</p>

            <h1>Phishing</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Although not a virus itself, phishing is a cyber threat that uses fraudulent emails, messages, or websites
            to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information. Social engineering exploits human psychology to
            manipulate victims into compromising security.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Phishing attacks typically impersonate trusted entities like banks, email providers, or government
            organizations. They rely on urgency, fear, or curiosity to trick users into clicking malicious links,
            downloading harmful files, or providing credentials.

            <h3>Common Techniques</h3>
            Phishing attacks may take the form of deceptive emails, fake login pages, or messages claiming account
            issues. Spear-phishing, a targeted version, focuses on specific individuals or organizations. Other
            techniques include vishing (voice phishing) and smishing (SMS phishing).

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            Successful phishing attacks can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and financial loss. Organizations may
            suffer reputational damage, while individuals risk losing access to accounts or sensitive personal
            information.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            The 2016 phishing attack on John Podesta, a political advisor, led to a massive email leak. More recent
            campaigns frequently impersonate popular services like PayPal or Microsoft to steal credentials.

            <h1>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</h1>
            <p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            APTs are sophisticated, prolonged cyberattacks targeting specific entities, such as governments,
            corporations, or research institutions. They aim to gain unauthorized access and maintain a presence within
            a network to steal data or disrupt operations over time.

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            APTs involve multiple stages, including reconnaissance, gaining initial access, establishing persistence,
            and executing the attack. They are often state-sponsored and use zero-day vulnerabilities or custom-built
            malware to bypass security measures.

            <h3>Attack Lifecycle</h3>
            The APT lifecycle begins with reconnaissance to gather intelligence on the target. Attackers then use
            spear-phishing, exploits, or malware to gain access. Once inside, they establish persistence through
            rootkits or backdoors, exfiltrate data, and remain undetected for months or years.

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            APTs can cause significant damage by stealing intellectual property, compromising critical infrastructure,
            or disrupting government operations. Their stealthy nature often delays detection, amplifying the damage
            caused.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            Stuxnet, a state-sponsored attack, targeted Iran’s nuclear program, causing physical damage to centrifuges.
            APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, is a Russian-linked group involved in cyber-espionage campaigns against
            governments and organizations.</p>
